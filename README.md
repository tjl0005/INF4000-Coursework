# INF4000-Coursework
### Summary
This repository contains the R code and visualisations produced that were completed as coursework for the INF4000 module at the University of Sheffield. The particular purpose of this project is to XYZ.

The composite visualisation is made up of the following:  
1. Collision frequency/severity at time of day - Circular time plot. Inform the viewer of safe times to drive and how time of day can be related to brightness on roads and tiredness.

2. Collisions with recorded dangerous factors (car lights on, weather, road surface) - Faceted pie chart. Inform viewer of things to be more careful with e.g. checking weather, driving slower depending on road surface and aware of their lights

3. Number of casualties and severities by age/sex - Grouped bar chart. Inform the viewer of the real-world effect of poor driving and use demographics to make it more personal.

4. Number of collisions by local authority district - Heatmap on UK map. Inform viewer of their local area so they can see impact on personal level

### Data
The data used is not directly available due to it's size but can be recreated using the provided links to the original data in junction with the R files in this repository. The data is cleaned and pre-processed as part of another project (available here) but further processing is done here in this repository for the visualisations.

The original driving license data used in this project is available at: https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/d0be1ed2-9907-4ec4-b552-c048f6aec16a/gb-driving-licence-data. For this project only the datasheets pertaining to penalty points across gender, ages and location are used.

The original collisions and casualty data is available at: https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data.
